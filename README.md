# AI Notebooks
Various Jupyter notebooks containing things tangential to AI/ML
 - [XOR Problem](https://nbviewer.org/github/epistemologist/AI_Notebooks/blob/main/XOR_Problem.ipynb): Visualizing the loss surface of a simple network trained on XOR
 - [MNIST](https://nbviewer.org/github/epistemologist/AI_Notebooks/blob/main/MNIST.ipynb): Some random visualizations of MNIST data as well as some videos showcasing the accuracy of a 1-nearest neighbor classifier
- [MNIST in PyTorch](https://nbviewer.org/github/epistemologist/AI_Notebooks/blob/main/MNIST_in_Pytorch.ipynb): Introductory example of using PyTorch to train a neural network on MNIST digits
- [Neural Network from Scratch](https://nbviewer.org/github/epistemologist/AI_Notebooks/blob/main/Neural_Network_from_Scratch.ipynb) Implementation of a neural network with 1 hidden layer following a tutorial by [Welch Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs), can get ~90% on binary MNIST
